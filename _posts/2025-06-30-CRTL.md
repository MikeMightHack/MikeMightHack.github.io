## Red Teams Ops II
The CRTO2 (Certified Red Team Lead), formerly known as CRTL, is one of the most respected certifications in the red teaming and offensive security community. Offered by ZeroPointSecurity, this course builds on the CRTO1 and focuses on advanced red team tradecraft, adversary emulation, and realistic attack simulations.

In this post, I‚Äôll share my experience going through the training, preparing for the exam, and some thoughts on the course and the exam.

### The Course
The CRTO2 feels a lot like CRTO1 in structure, but this time with evasion always in mind. Everything you learn is about staying one step ahead of detections and operating as stealthily as possible.

The course covers a wide range of advanced topics, including:

- C2 Infrastructure ‚Äì How to build and manage your own red team infrastructure, using redirectors to stay hidden and resilient against detections.

- Windows APIs ‚Äì A gentle introduction to the Windows API using C++, C#, and even VBA, giving you the foundations for deeper malware development.

- Process Injection ‚Äì How to download and inject shellcode into Windows processes.

- Defense Evasion ‚Äì Core strategies for staying under the radar of modern defenses.

- Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) ‚Äì Understanding Microsoft‚Äôs ASR rules and exploring bypass techniques.

- Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) ‚Äì How WDAC works, and the different ways to bypass its restrictions.

- Protected Processes ‚Äì Detecting and working around protected processes.

- EDR Evasion ‚Äì A deep dive into how Endpoint Detection and Response solutions work, and practical techniques for evading them.

The course is very well structured and gives you solid entry-level knowledge in malware development and adversary simulation. You don‚Äôt just learn concepts ‚Äî you get to apply them in a way that feels realistic and practical.

One of the best parts is the lab environment, which comes with an Elastic EDR pre-configured. This gives you the chance to test your implants and payloads against real detections. My recommendation: turn on all Elastic detections during your practice ‚Äî it‚Äôs the best way to measure the effectiveness of your initial access and improve your evasion skills.

### The Exam
The CRTO2 exam gives you 96 hours of runtime within an 8-day window to complete the objectives. To pass, you need to capture 5 out of 6 flags. Honestly, the time is more than enough if you‚Äôve gone through the course material and practiced your evasion techniques ‚Äî you shouldn‚Äôt run into major problems.

It‚Äôs not mandatory to have the CRTO before attempting CRTO2, but I‚Äôd highly recommend it. The knowledge from CRTO1 really helps you move more confidently through the challenges in CRTO2, especially when it comes to mindset and methodology.

One interesting thing about the exam is that not all Elastic EDR detections are enabled. If you‚Äôve practiced in the labs with all detections turned on, you‚Äôll find the exam environment a bit less restrictive.

The key to success is having your initial implant prepared and keeping in mind everything you learned during the course. Good planning, persistence, and stealth will carry you through.

### Final Thoughts

I can totally recommend the CRTO2 certification. Just like with CRTO1, the course is very well structured, the labs work flawlessly, and the exam runs smoothly. Overall, the entire experience is a solid 10/10.

Another big plus is the price. Compared to other providers that offer similar (or even less complete) training for much higher costs, ZeroPointSecurity keeps it affordable and accessible.

For me, CRTO2 is not only a great advanced red team course, but also an excellent introduction to malware development and EDR evasion techniques.

If you‚Äôre thinking about taking it, go for it ‚Äî you won‚Äôt regret it.

### Resources

During the course, I developed my own initial implant, which I later used as the base for the exam. I‚Äôve shared a version of it on my GitHub, along with a C2 malleable profile and some links to useful resources that I found helpful during my preparation:
