## New Series: Solving Web Security Academy Labs on YouTube!

Hey everyone!

Iâ€™m excited to kick off a new series both here on the blog and over on my YouTube channel! ðŸŽ‰ Iâ€™ll be tackling the Web Security Academy from PortSwigger and creating video tutorials on how to solve their labs. If youâ€™re looking to improve your web security skills, these posts are for you!

Each post will focus on one learning path, and Iâ€™ll upload a video for each lab within that path. This way, you can follow along step by step and learn as we go.

Quick heads-up: the videos will be in Spanish, and Iâ€™m just starting out with video creation, so apologies in advance for the unique editing style. ðŸ˜… Theyâ€™re simple screen recordings (no fancy intros, no face camsâ€”just me, the labs, and my trusty mouse). Hopefully, the content will make up for the lack of Hollywood production!

For this first post, Iâ€™m covering the API Testing learning path, which includes 4 labs. Whether you're curious about API vulnerabilities or just want to brush up on your skills, youâ€™re in the right place!

Thanks for joining me on this journeyâ€”hopefully, weâ€™ll learn (and maybe cry) together as we work through these labs. ðŸ˜„ Donâ€™t forget to subscribe to my YouTube channel for the latest updates, and feel free to reach out with any questions or feedback!

Letâ€™s crack those labs!

Here are the videos:

### Lab 1: Exploiting an API endpoint using documentation
To solve this lab, you'll need to know:

- What API documentation is.
- How API documentation may be useful to an attacker.
- How to discover API documentation.

### Lab 2: Finding and exploiting an unused API endpoint
To solve this lab, you'll need to know:

- How to use URL query syntax to attempt to change a server-side request.
- How to use error messages to build an understanding of how a server-side API processes user input.

### Lab 3: Exploiting a mass assignment vulnerability
To solve this lab, you'll need to know:

- How to use error messages to construct a valid request.
- How HTTP methods are used by RESTful APIs.
- How changing the HTTP method can reveal additional functionality.

To solve this lab, you'll need to know:

- What mass assignment is.
- Why mass assignment may result in hidden parameters.
- How to identify hidden parameters.
- How to exploit mass assignment vulnerabilities.
