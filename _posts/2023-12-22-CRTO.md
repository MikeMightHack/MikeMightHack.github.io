## Red Teams Ops
On 22 December 2023 I obtained my Red Team Operator certification offered by Zero-Point Security.

Red Team Ops is an online, self-study course that teaches the basic principles, tools and techniques synonymous with red teaming.

The Exam is a practical CTF-style event driven by Snap Labs.  It's an assumed breach scenario by which the student must emulate an adversary using the provided threat profile as a guide.

[Here](https://eu.badgr.com/public/assertions/SCH0QtZvRAOdm-6TZW-CmQ?trk=public_profile_certification-title) you can see my certification Bagde.

My opinion about the course and the exam is that it is a very good option for intermediate profiles who want to go into Red Teaming. The course is very well explained and so is the presentation. You are not going to find yourself with an 800 page pdf. The lab is very stable and includes all the tools you need. 
The whole course is based on using Cobalt Strike, a great C2 that will make your life much easier. 
I really enjoyed it, both the course and the exam. For the exam, if you have done the course you will be able to pass it without any problem. That's another thing I liked, you won't find anything you haven't seen in the theory.

Below is a diagram I made during the study, showing some of the steps in the flow of a Red Team exercise learnt during the course.
